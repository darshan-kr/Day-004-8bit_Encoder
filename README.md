# Day-004-8bit_Encoder
An encoder is a digital circuit that converts a set of binary inputs into a unique binary code. The binary code represents the position of the input and is used to identify the specific input that is active. Encoders are commonly used in digital systems to convert a parallel set of inputs into a serial code.
